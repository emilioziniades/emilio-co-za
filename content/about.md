## who am I?

My name is Emilio Ziniades.
I am a South African.
I was born in Johannesburg and live in Cape Town.
I studied an undergraduate degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics, followed by an honours degree in Economics, at the University of Cape Town.
I graduated in 2019.
I am a software developer.
You can find my full resume <a href="/resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

## economist-turned-programmer

Being in lockdown shortly after graduating gave me the space I needed to explore computers and programming languages, with which I had always been fascinated.

I learnt Python from an amalgam of textbooks, online courses, documentation and YouTube videos.
My exploration then spread to a variety of other topics and languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Go.
Then I realized how little I knew about computer science concepts such as Big-O notation, algorithms and data structures, and so I tried to combine practical projects and theoretical concepts.

## what do I do?

During my time at the University of Cape Town, I worked as a teaching assistant in the Economics and Philosophy departments.
Then, I worked for myself as a freelancer, tutoring university and high school students.
At some point, I also began to pick up some freelance programming jobs.
This gave me the experience I needed to get my first fulltime job as a software developer.

## What am I interested in?

Coming from an economics background, one of my interests is data analysis.
I have also learnt a lot about cryptocurrencies.
It became apparent to me that cryptocurrencies represent the merging of economics and computer science.

Growing up in South Africa, I am very sensitive to social and economic inequality, and this perspective informs my approach to cryptocurrencies.
Whilst they have enormous potential, I also recognize the very real risks of wealth concentration that exist.

More recently, I have been [bazaar-pilled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar). As a frequent user of open-source software, I became interested in contributing back to the software that I use. You can see some of my contributions [here](@/open-source.md#contributions).

## maybe we could work together?

Although I am currently happily employed, I am also always on the lookout for new opportunities.
I am open to remote work.
