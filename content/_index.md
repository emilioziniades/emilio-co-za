Hey! I'm Emilio.

I'm a software developer, chess-enjoyer, and my yiayia's [palikari](https://greekerthanthegreeks.com/lost-in-translation-word-of-day-palikari/).

I live in Cape Town and work in the finance industry.
My main focus is backend development, developer tools and devops.
I'm also interested in open-source software, and here are [some of my contributions](@/open-source.md#contributions).

I'm happy at my current job, but I also won't close myself off to new opportunities.
You can [learn more about me](@/about.md), and if you think I would be a good fit, feel free to [reach out](mailto:emilioziniades@gmail.com).
