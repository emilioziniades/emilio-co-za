Hey! I'm Emilio and this is my website.
It's a home for the [things I write](@/blog/_index.md) and the [software I build](@/code/_index.md).

I'm a software developer working in the finance industry.
My main focus has been backend development, DevOps pipelines and automated infrastructure provisioning.
I'm also interested in open source software, and you can see some of my contributions here (TODO).

I'm loving my current work, but I also won't close my self off to new opportunities.
You can [learn more about me](@/about/_index.md), and if you think I would be a good fit, feel free to [submit a form](@/contact/_index.md).
