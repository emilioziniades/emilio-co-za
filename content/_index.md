Hey! I'm Emilio and this is my website.

It's a home for the [things I write](@/blog/_index.md) and the [software I build](@/code/_index.md).

I'm a software developer, living in Cape Town, South Africa, and working in the finance industry.
My main focus is backend development, CICD pipelines and automated infrastructure provisioning.
I'm also interested in open source software, here are [some of my contributions](@/open-source.md).

I'm happy at my current work, but I also won't close myself off to new opportunities.
You can [learn more about me](@/about.md), and if you think I would be a good fit, feel free to [submit a form](@/contact.md).
