Hey! I'm Emilio and this is my website.

It's a home for the [things I write](@/blog/_index.md) and the [software I build](@/code/_index.md).

I'm a software developer working in the finance industry.
My main focus is backend development, CICD pipelines and automated infrastructure provisioning.
I'm also interested in open source software, here are [some of my contributions](@/code/_index.md).

I'm happy at my current work, but I also won't close myself off to new opportunities.
You can [learn more about me](@/about/_index.md), and if you think I would be a good fit, feel free to [submit a form](@/contact/_index.md).
